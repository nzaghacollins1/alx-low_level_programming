The **C pogramming language** has been around for about **3 solid decades**... buddy isn't planning on leaving the stage anytime soon.

This folder(s) contains some foundational learning into the C programming language. You may come across files/cod on **creating your own header files**, **debugging**, and **functions and nested loops**, etc.

* Have a nice time while browsing through these folders.
